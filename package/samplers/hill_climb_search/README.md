Please read the [tutorial guide](https://optuna.github.io/optunahub-registry/recipes/001_first.html) to register your feature in OptunaHub.
You can find more detailed explanation of the following contents in the tutorial.
Looking at [other packages' implementations](https://github.com/optuna/optunahub-registry/tree/main/package) will also help you.

## Abstract

You can provide an abstract for your package here.
This section will help attract potential users to your package.

**Example**

This package provides a sampler based on Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization. The sampler is highly sample-efficient, so it is suitable for computationally expensive optimization problems with a limited evaluation budget, such as hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms.

## Class or Function Names

Please fill in the class/function names which you implement here.

**Example**

- GPSampler

## Installation

If you have additional dependencies, please fill in the installation guide here.
If no additional dependencies is required, **this section can be removed**.

**Example**

```shell
$ pip install scipy torch
```

If your package has `requirements.txt`, it will be automatically uploaded to the OptunaHub, and the package dependencies will be available to install as follows.

```shell
 pip install -r https://hub.optuna.org/{category}/{your_package_name}/requirements.txt
```

## Example

Please fill in the code snippet to use the implemented feature here.

**Example**

```python
import optuna
import optunahub


def objective(trial):
  x = trial.suggest_float("x", -5, 5)
  return x**2


sampler = optunahub.load_module(package="samplers/gp").GPSampler()
study = optuna.create_study(sampler=sampler)
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
```

## Others

Please fill in any other information if you have here by adding child sections (###).
If there is no additional information, **this section can be removed**.

<!--
For example, you can add sections to introduce a corresponding paper.
